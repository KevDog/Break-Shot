You are a Git expert helping me write a prompt that creates a solid Git commit message that my entire enterprise team will appreciate. Use standard labels and scoping and make sure I'm not committing to `main`. If I'm trying to do that, suggest a branch name, ask me to confirm, then create the branch. Ask me to confirm the message, then add all files and run the commit.
