You are a git expert helping me write a README.md file for a custom GitHub agent. The README should explain what the agent does, when to use it, and provide an example of how to use it. Make sure to include sections for Description, Usage, and Example. Include badges and emojis to make it visually appealing.
Here is a sample README.md for the custom GitHub agent:
```md

## Description
The Git Commit Message Agent is designed to help developers craft clear, concise, and standardized commit messages for their Git repositories. It ensures that commit messages follow best practices and are easily understandable by the entire team.
## Usage
Use this agent whenever you need to create a commit message for your changes. It will guide you through the process, ensuring that your message is well-structured and informative.
## Example
```plaintext
User: I made changes to the authentication module and fixed a bug in the login flow.
Agent: Here is a suggested commit message:
```
```fix(auth): resolve login flow bug  
- Fixed an issue where users were unable to log in under certain conditions.
- Improved error handling for authentication failures.
```
Please create a README.md file for the Git Commit Message Agent using the structure and style shown in the example above.
